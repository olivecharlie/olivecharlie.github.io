# Pages Setup

1. To create a User Pages site, name the repository using the naming scheme:
    ``` 
    <username>.github.io 
    ```
2. Clone repo locally:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/olivecharlie/olivecharlie.github.io.git
    ```
3. Go to Settings for the newly created repo, select a theme and commit. Update the local verion with a `pull`. This step adds an updated `README.md` file and a `config.yaml` file
